During the XXI dynasty the viscera were returned to the body after their mummification.
 
The canopic trousseau had become so traditional that it did not stop being used; in this way the burials of nobles and kings continued to include them, but empty.
 
Already for the next dynasty the jars were solid pieces not excavated in their interior, sample of truinfo of the form on the function. These continued to be used until the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty.

From the First Intermediate Period the caps of the jars begin to be represented with a human head, instead of the flat or vaulted features of the Old Kingdom.
 
Likewise, the viscera occasionally appear covered by carton masks, also with human heads inside the jars.
 
In this period, the anthropomorphic figures seem to have represented the deceased, instead of the minor gods protecting the organs as they would later. This is shown by the texts placed on the glasses and chests, which only contain the name of the deceased.

In the Ramesside period, the lid of the vessel acquires the shape of the head of each of the geniuses who protected the functioning of the organ in the living body. Called Sons of Horus, they protected their contents from destruction. The deities represented were:

Details: The first real canopic burials were constituted by an alabaster chest (calcite), divided into four compartments containing the organs of the deceased immersed in a solution of natron (natural mixture of common salt and sodium bicarbonate).
 
Since the IV dynasty it was common to place the niche for these burials at ground level or the wall in a southeasterly direction relative to the distal end of the sarcophagus in the mortuary chamber. These first niches probably contained wooden chests, although at the end of this dynasty only canopic vases appear, with flat or vaulted tops.

At the end of the Middle Kingdom the canopic trousseau is complete: An exterior stone coffer, similar to the sarcophagus; another wooden interior, similar to the coffin; both containing the four alabaster glasses.
 
During the XVII dynasty, the traditional rectangular wooden interior chest was replaced by one with a mummiform appearance; in the same way, the outer chest begins to lodge a seated fugura by Anubis Upuaut in the upper part.
 
At the beginning of the XVIII dynasty the decoration changes again, focusing on the images of the four protective goddesses and the four minor deities, now with the exterior chest imitating a naos.
